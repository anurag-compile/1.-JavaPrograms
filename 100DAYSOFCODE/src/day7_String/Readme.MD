## What is String in Java?
Generally, String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.

#### How to create a string object?
There are two ways to create String object:

1. By string literal
2. By new keyword 

#### Example -

char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'};  
String s=new String(ch);  
is same as:

String s="javatpoint"; 

### today's Problem

PROBLEM - Java Substring Comparisons (https://lnkd.in/g98647yR)

GitHub Repo Link - https://lnkd.in/ghRV-98N

#### Explanation - 
String s = "welcometojava" has the following lexicographically-ordered subtring of length k = 3:
We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\n wel).
The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.

#### Possible Test Cases are:

#### Test Case 1:

#### Input -

1. welcometojava

2. 3


#### Output -
1. ava

2. wel

#### Test Case 2:

#### Input -

1. welcomeToJava

2. 3


#### Output -

1. Jav

2. wel
