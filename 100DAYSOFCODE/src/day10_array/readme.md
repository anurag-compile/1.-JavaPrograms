### Program to find the frequency of each element in the array
In this program, we have an array of elements to count the occurrence of its each element. One of the approaches to resolve this problem is to maintain one array to store the counts of each element of the array. Loop through the array and count the occurrence of each element as frequency and store it in another array fr.

1    2   8  3   2   2   2   5   1

In the given array, 1 has appeared two times so its frequency be 2 and 2 has appeared four times so have frequency 4 and so on.
#### Input
arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10}

#### Output:
Frequency of 1 is: 3

Frequency of 2 is: 1

Frequency of 3 is: 2

Frequency of 5 is: 2

Frequency of 8 is: 3

Frequency of 9 is: 2

Frequency of 10 is: 1

#### Input
arr[] = {2, 2, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 11}

#### Output

Frequency of 2 is: 2

Frequency of 6 is: 2

Frequency of 7 is: 3

Frequency of 11 is: 1
