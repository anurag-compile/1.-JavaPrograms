## Insert element in Array using new Array in Java

We can insert an element at a specific position in two different ways,

a.) Using a new array

b.) With the help of ArrayList.

#### Example :-
Array = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

Element to be inserted = 99;

Position = 3;

Final result = {10, 20, 30, 99, 40, 50};


#### In this approach :-
a) Take a position and new array element.

b) Create a new array with the size of n+1, where n is the size of the original array.

c) Copy the element of the original array to the new array until position-1 index.

d) Insert an element at position index

e) Copy remaining elements of original array to new array

f) Return the new array
