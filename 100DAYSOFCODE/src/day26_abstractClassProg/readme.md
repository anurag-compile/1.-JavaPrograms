# Abstraction in Java
1. Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity and
   showing the functionality. Showing the essential data and hiding the non
   essential data.
2. We can understand this by taking a real world example. We
   have fan in house, we are just provided with a switch (functionality) to turn
   on and off the fan, we are not aware of how the fan actually works
   (complexity). This is a perfect example of abstraction in java.

### Abstraction in java is achieved by two ways:
1. Abstract Class (Partial implementation of abstraction)

2. Interface (Fully implementation of abstraction)

### Abstract Class in Java

A class which has zero or more abstract methods is known as
abstract class. It can also have non abstract methods.
Abstract class can‚Äôt be instantiated. It means we can‚Äôt
create object of an abstract class. However we can create its reference variable.

### Abstract Method in Java

Abstract method is a method without body. Abstract class and
abstract method is declared using ‚Äúabstract‚Äù keyword. Below is an example.


abstract class Demo        //abstract class

{

abstract void add(int a, int b);     //abstract method
