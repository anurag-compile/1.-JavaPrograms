# Java Package
A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.

There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc.

Here, we will have the detailed learning of creating and using user-defined packages.

### Advantage of Java Package
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.

2) Java package provides access protection.

3) Java package removes naming collision.

### Simple example of java package
The package keyword is used to create a package in java.

//save as Simple.java  
package mypack;  
public class Simple{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
System.out.println("Welcome to package");  
}  
}


### Subpackage in java
Package inside the package is called the subpackage. It should be created to categorize the package further.

### Example of Subpackage
package com.javatpoint.core;  
class Simple{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
System.out.println("Hello subpackage");  
}  
}
