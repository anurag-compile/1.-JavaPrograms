### Java Program to determine whether one string is a rotation of another
In this program, we need to check whether a string is a rotation of another string or not.

String 1: abcde  
String 2: deabc  
String 1 + String 1: abcdeabcde

Consider the above example, suppose we need to check whether string 2 is a rotation of string 1. To find this, we concatenate string 1 with string 1. Then, try to find the string 2 in concatenated string. If string 2 is present in concatenated string then, string 2 is rotation of string 1. String 2 deabc is found on the index 3 in concatenated string. So, deabc is rotation of abcde.
