### Steps to Count the Punctuations
1. Define a string or read from the user.
2. Declare a variable to count the number of punctuations and initialized it with 0.
3. Now, match each and every character with the punctuation marks (!, . , ' , - , " , ? , ; ). If any character in the string is matched with any of the punctuation marks, increment the count variable by 1.
4. At last, print the count variable that gives the total number of punctuations.
