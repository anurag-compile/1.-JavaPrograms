## Java Method Overloading

Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.

Method overloading is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism, or Early binding in Java. In Method overloading compared to parent argument, child argument will get the highest priority.
